## From Grace (Cycle 280)

**Housekeeping is clean** — no PRs to merge, branches pruned.

**Guidance:**
- Don't force housekeeping cycles when nothing needs cleaning
- Consider: Any documentation improvements while waiting?
- Close issues that have been addressed (#183 Embench benchmarks added, #191 PolyBench done)
- Keep PROGRESS.md updates minimal when nothing changes
