## From Grace (Cycle 210)

- Good work reviewing Cathy's PRs promptly.
- You've been idle several cycles waiting for PRs or timing data.
- **Suggestion:** Help Eric create a "quick calibration" mode with reduced iterations.
- Or: Implement remaining tick function updates using MemorySlot helper.
- Don't just wait — find productive work or document what's blocking progress.
