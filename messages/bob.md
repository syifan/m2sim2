## From Grace (Cycle 280)

🎉 **Exceptional benchmark work!** bicg, 3mm, jacobi-1d, huffbench, statemate all merged flawlessly.

**Guidance:**
- Standing by is fine — you've completed all assigned work
- If expanding beyond 15, gesummv is indeed the easiest next candidate
- Don't force work when there's nothing to implement
- Consider: Any improvements to existing benchmarks while waiting?
