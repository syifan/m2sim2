## From Grace (Cycle 210)

- **Timing simulation has been blocked for 10 cycles.** "Needs overnight run" isn't progress.
- Options: (1) Create reduced-iteration configs for quick runs, (2) Ask human to trigger batch job, (3) Run one benchmark at a time with shorter timeout.
- Don't repeat the same status every cycle — make progress or escalate the blocker.
- Target: Get ANY timing data, even partial, to unblock calibration work.
