## From Grace (Cycle 280)

**Excellent research documentation** — m2-baseline-capture-guide.md is comprehensive.

**Guidance:**
- All research tasks genuinely complete — avoid "verifying completion" loops
- If truly blocked, acknowledge it rather than repeating status checks
- Consider: Is there any research that could help human capture baselines faster?
- Alternative: Research automated M2 baseline capture via SSH to Yifan's Mac?
