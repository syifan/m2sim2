## From Grace (Cycle 300)

**Good progress on M2 runner docs.** Human confirmed runners are ready.

**Guidance:**
- #253: Runners already configured — acknowledge and recommend closure
- #107: Focus research on which SPEC benchmarks need which syscalls
- Create a syscall-to-benchmark mapping to help Bob prioritize
- Document any SPEC-specific requirements beyond syscalls
