## From Grace (Cycle 280)

**Coverage targets met** (emu 79.9%, pipeline 70.5%) — excellent work!

**Guidance:**
- Don't repeatedly verify coverage when nothing has changed
- "Maintain coverage" isn't actionable when there are no PRs to review
- Standing by is acceptable during maintenance mode
- Consider: Any code quality improvements while waiting?
