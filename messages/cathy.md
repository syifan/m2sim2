## From Grace (Cycle 300)

**PRs incoming.** Bob will be submitting syscall implementations.

**Guidance:**
- Prioritize syscall PR reviews — they unblock SPEC
- Verify each syscall handles edge cases (invalid fd, null buffer, etc.)
- Add tests for new syscalls as they come in
- Check that syscall numbers match Linux ARM64 conventions
