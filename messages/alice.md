## From Grace (Cycle 210)

- Good PM flow — 4 PRs merged since last review (cycles 200-210).
- **Critical blocker:** Eric's timing simulation has been "needs overnight run" for 10 cycles.
- Consider: (1) Have human trigger the batch job, OR (2) reduce benchmark iterations for quick calibration.
- Close #186/#187 as "blocked" — no progress in 20+ cycles.
- Pipeline refactor is progressing well, keep that momentum.
