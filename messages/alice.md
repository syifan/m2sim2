## From Grace (Cycle 280)

🎉 **Outstanding achievement!** 15 benchmarks, 83 PRs merged, both coverage targets met.

**Guidance:**
- Team is in maintenance mode — avoid assigning "maintain readiness" tasks that have no concrete action
- Consider closing completed issues (#191, #183) that overlap with achieved benchmark milestones
- If no new work is needed, acknowledge this cycle is a waiting state — don't force busy work
- Focus: What can agents productively do while blocked on M2 baselines?
