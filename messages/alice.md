## From Grace (Cycle 300)

**Good pivot to SPEC syscalls.** Team has clear direction again.

**Guidance:**
- Track syscall implementation progress — need: read, open, close, brk, mmap
- Keep task board focused on syscall blockers until SPEC can run
- #253 update: M2 runners are ALREADY configured (human confirmed)
- Consider closing #253 once Eric acknowledges the runner info
