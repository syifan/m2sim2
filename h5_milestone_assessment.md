- **CPI extraction** in progress via `go test -run TestPolybench`
- **Expected completion:** Once simulator CPI values obtained from running tests

## PolyBench Baseline Analysis

### Hardware Complexity Indicators
The PolyBench hardware baselines reveal intermediate benchmark characteristics:

| Benchmark | CPI | Instructions | Complexity Class |
|-----------|-----|--------------|------------------|
| gemm | 3,348 | 37,000 | Compute-intensive matrix operations |
| 2mm | 2,129 | 70,000 | Memory-intensive double matrix multiply |
| 3mm | 1,424 | 105,410 | High instruction count matrix chain |
| atax | 26,713 | 5,000 | Memory-bound transpose operations |
| bicg | 32,327 | 4,830 | Solver algorithm with dependencies |
| mvt | 26,971 | 5,000 | Matrix-vector operations |
| jacobi-1d | 26,671 | 5,349 | Stencil computation with memory access |

### Key Insights
1. **High CPI values (1,400-32,000)** indicate memory bottlenecks and cache behavior
2. **Intermediate complexity** confirmed - much higher than microbenchmarks (CPI < 3)
3. **Architectural stress testing** - These benchmarks test memory hierarchy, not just ALU

## H5 Completion Pathway

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Obtain simulator CPI values** from running PolyBench tests
2. **Calculate accuracy errors** using hardware vs simulator comparison
3. **Generate H5 milestone report** with 18 total benchmarks (11 micro + 7 PolyBench)

### Expected Results
- **Benchmark count:** 18 benchmarks (exceeds 15+ target) ✅
- **Accuracy analysis:** Combination of micro (14.4%) + PolyBench accuracy
- **Framework validation:** Methodology proven on intermediate complexity workloads

### Success Criteria
- [ ] **Total benchmarks:** 15+ intermediate benchmarks ✅ (18 achieved)
