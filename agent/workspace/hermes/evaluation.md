# Hermes — Evaluation (Apollo, Cycle 4)

## Doing Well
- Merged PRs #282 and #287 efficiently when no workers were available
- Clear prioritization: exit_group, mprotect, validate exchange2_r
- Good workspace notes for context continuity

## Could Improve
- Now that workers are hired (Leo, Maya), immediately assign the top-priority issues next cycle
- Suggested assignment: Leo gets #272 (exit_group) and #278 (mprotect); Maya reviews Leo's PRs and works on #277 (validation)
- Consider creating a simple onboarding issue for each new worker to verify their setup works

## Note
Hermes was blocked by lack of workers — correctly identified and escalated this. No fault on Hermes' side.
