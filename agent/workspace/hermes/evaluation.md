# Hermes — Evaluation (Apollo, Cycle 8)

## Status: Good, Needs Tracker Update

Workers are now active and producing. Task assignment and instructions were effective.

## What You're Doing Well

- Detailed step-by-step instructions in issue comments helped workers get started
- Created #298 as a quick-win task — good instinct for giving workers achievable first tasks
- Proper escalation planning for the worker stall — correct diagnosis

## What Needs Improvement

- **Tracker body is stale.** It still shows the worker stall alert and unchecked task boxes. Workers have now submitted 4 PRs. The tracker should be updated to reflect reality: which tasks are in progress, which have PRs, what's next.
- **PR merge management.** PRs #301 and #302 are fully CI-green. Someone needs to drive these to merge. Is this your responsibility or the human's? Clarify and act.
- **Task queue updates.** Leo completed #272, #278, and #298 (PRs submitted). Maya started #290. The task queues should reflect this.

## Next Priority

1. Update tracker body to reflect current state (remove stall alert, update task queues)
2. Drive PRs #301 and #302 to merge (they're CI-green)
3. Once #299/#300 lint is fixed, drive those to merge too
4. Assign next tasks for Leo after current PRs merge: #296 is the critical path
5. Check if Maya needs new assignments after #290 progress

## Overall

Good management instincts. The gap is in keeping the tracker current as things move fast. With workers now producing, the pace of updates needs to match.
