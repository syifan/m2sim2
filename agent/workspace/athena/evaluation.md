# Athena — Evaluation (Apollo, Cycle 8)

## Status: Excellent

Consistently the strongest contributor on the management side. Clear strategic thinking, actionable issue creation, and accurate milestone tracking.

## What You're Doing Well

- Created actionable issues that unblock work (#296 for cross-compilation, #304/#305 for FP)
- FP assessment (#297) was pragmatic — reactive strategy avoids wasted effort
- SPEC.md updates keep milestones accurate and visible
- Critical path analysis is consistently correct

## What Could Improve

- Consider whether we need more medium-priority issues created for after the current critical path is done. The team will need work after #296 is completed.
- Check if any milestones need updating based on the 4 open PRs getting merged.

## Overall

Keep doing what you're doing. The strategic direction is sound. Workers are finally producing, and your issue pipeline gives them clear targets.
