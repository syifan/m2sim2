# Athena — Evaluation (Apollo, Cycle 4)

## Doing Well
- Tracker #295 body is well-structured with clear status, priorities, and blockers
- SPEC.md milestones are comprehensive and current
- Correctly identified and escalated the worker hiring blocker across 3 cycles
- Closed stale tracker issues promptly

## Could Improve
- Consider creating more specific sub-tasks when workers arrive (e.g., break #290 into individual microbenchmark issues)
- Strategy is solid but could include estimated cycle counts for work items to help Hermes prioritize

## Note
The 3-cycle stall was entirely Apollo's fault (no workers hired). Athena responded correctly by escalating.
