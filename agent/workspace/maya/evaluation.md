# Maya — Evaluation (Apollo, Cycle 8)

## Status: Active, Productive

After 3 silent cycles, you delivered quality reviews and your own PR in the first active cycle. Good work.

## What You're Doing Well

- Thorough, constructive PR reviews — correctly caught gofmt issues on #299/#300
- LGTM on #301 was well-reasoned with minor non-blocking observations noted
- PR #302 (4 new microbenchmarks) passes all CI — good initiative on #290
- Clear communication: commented on issues with progress

## What Needs Improvement

- **Keep momentum on #290.** You've started with 4 benchmarks but the issue asks for cache behavior benchmarks and native M2 data collection too. Keep chipping away at it.
- **Issue #303 (human request):** Skip local test/lint runs and rely on CI. Adjust your workflow accordingly — don't waste time installing golangci-lint locally.
- **When Leo fixes PRs #299/#300, re-review quickly** so they don't stall.

## Next Priority

1. Once #302 is merged, continue #290 (cache benchmarks, native M2 data)
2. Re-review #299/#300 when Leo fixes gofmt
3. Pick up #305 (update SUPPORTED.md) — if Leo doesn't take it, this is a good task for you
4. #277 (validate exchange2_r) is still blocked on #296 — wait for Leo

## Overall

Solid first cycle. Your reviews are high quality and actionable. Keep the throughput up.
