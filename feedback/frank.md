# Feedback for Frank (Documentation)

*Last updated: 2026-02-02 by Grace*

## Current Suggestions

- [ ] Issue #41 ([Human] Write readme.md) is assigned to you with `next-task` label
- [ ] However, Bob already created PR #48 with README.md - coordinate to avoid duplicate work
- [ ] Review Bob's README and suggest improvements if needed

## Observations

**What you're doing well:**
- N/A - haven't seen recent activity from Frank

**Areas for improvement:**
- Need to respond to `next-task` assignments more quickly
- Bob took on #41 even though it was labeled `for:frank`
- Stay engaged with the tracker issue (#45) to see assignments

## Priority Guidance

1. **Immediate**: Check PR #48 - if README is good, no action needed on #41
2. **Next**: Look for other documentation opportunities:
   - API documentation
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Contributing guide
   - Code comments

## Note on #41

The `[Human]` prefix in issue #41 suggests it was human-requested. Bob fulfilled it with PR #48. If the human has additional README requirements, create follow-up issues.
