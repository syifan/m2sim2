## Cycle 263 Updates

### ✅ **Accuracy Validation Complete!**

Bob ran accuracy validation with hot branch benchmark:

| Benchmark | Sim CPI | M2 CPI | Error | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| arithmetic_8wide | 0.250 | 0.268 | **7.2%** | ✅ Excellent |
| branch_conditional | 1.600 | 1.190 | **34.5%** | ❌ Folding disabled |

**Hot Branch Loop Results:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cycles | 22 |
| Instructions | 15 |
| CPI | 1.467 |
| Pipeline Flushes | 4 |
| **FoldedBranches** | **0** |

**FoldedBranches = 0** because zero-cycle branch folding was disabled (commit 1590518) to fix infinite loops. To improve branch accuracy, zero-cycle folding needs safe reimplementation with misprediction recovery.

## Key Achievements

**75 PRs Merged!**

**Emu Coverage Target Exceeded!**
| Package | Coverage | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| emu | 79.9% | ✅ Above 70% target! |
| pipeline | 65.3% | ⚠️ Dropped (new branch handling code) |

**8-Wide Infrastructure Validated!**
- All timing simulator fixes complete and working
- Hot branch benchmark validates 8-wide backward branch loops

## Accuracy Status (Microbenchmarks)

| Benchmark | Sim CPI | M2 CPI | Error | Target |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| arithmetic_8wide | 0.250 | 0.268 | **7.2%** | ✅ <20% |
| dependency_chain | 1.200 | 1.009 | 18.9% | ✅ <20% |
| branch_conditional | 1.600 | 1.190 | **34.5%** | ❌ <20% |
| **Average** | — | — | **20.2%** | ⚠️ ~20% |

**Branch error (34.5%)** is the highest remaining gap. Zero-cycle folding disabled for correctness — needs safe reimplementation.

## Next Steps

1. **Reimplement zero-cycle folding** with proper misprediction recovery
2. **PolyBench Phase 1 (#237)** — add gemm/atax benchmarks for more diverse validation
3. **Close accuracy investigation issues** when targets met

## Root Cause Analysis — Timing Simulator Backward Branch Handling

Five fixes were required to make 8-wide backward branch loops work:

1. **PSTATE forwarding (9d7c2e6)** — Added flag fields to EXMEM 2-8
2. **Same-cycle forwarding (48851e7)** — B.cond checks `nextEXMEM*` for same-cycle flags
3. **Branch handling (d159a73)** — Added misprediction handling for slots 2-8
4. **Zero-cycle folding (1590518)** — Disabled unsafe branch folding for conditional branches
5. **Test count fix (eb70656)** — Updated expected benchmark count 11→12

**Why unit tests passed but acceptance tests hung:**
- Unit tests run in single-issue mode → B.NE in slot 0 (has handling)
- Acceptance tests run in 8-wide mode → B.NE in slot 2 (needed all 5 fixes)

All fixes now merged! Hot branch benchmark validates the 8-wide timing simulator works correctly.
